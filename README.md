# Cisco-Ansible-Playbooks

Ansible is a powerful tool that has become very popular in application deployment, service provisioning and general IT automation tasks. Ansible uses a system of "playbooks" written in YAML to describe automation and configuration management jobs.

#### This is the process Ansible usually uses when executing a task on a managed node (see Introduction to Ansible video from Ansible for Networking Engineers webinar for more details).

-Collect the Python code that is required by the task (module source code + libraries referenced by the module);
-Open an SSH connection to the managed node;
-Copy source code to a temporary directory on the managed node;
-Execute Python code on the managed node;
-Collect results and return them to Ansible playbook.


#### Most of these steps cannot be executed on a typical switch or router. Networking modules thus use a different approach:

-Python code is executed on Ansible host;
-The code executed on Ansible host generates commands to be sent to the managed device, open SSH or NETCONF connection to the managed device, and executes the commands;
-The printouts generated by the managed device are parsed and returned as module results to Ansible playbook.
